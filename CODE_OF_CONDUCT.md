## Specific Community Guidelines

### Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code:

✅ **Do:**
- Be constructive and helpful
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good work
- Ask questions to understand intent
- Suggest improvements, not commands
- Be specific about issues
- Provide resources or examples

❌ **Don't:**
- Use dismissive language
- Attack the author personally
- Reject code without explanation
- Block progress without helping fix issues
- Make demands without context
- Ignore the author's perspective
- Use sarcasm or passive-aggressive comments

**Example of Good Review Comment:**
```
Good catch on using a loop here. I'm wondering if we could
simplify this using `grep` instead? Something like:

```bash
grep "pattern" file.txt
```

This would be more efficient for large files. What do you think?
```

**Example of Bad Review Comment:**
```
This is inefficient. Use grep.
```

### Discussion Guidelines

When discussing in issues, pull requests, or discussions:

✅ **Do:**
- Stay on topic
- Be respectful of different opinions
- Provide context and links
- Use threads to keep discussions organized

- Use discussions to promote unrelated projects
- Spam or send repetitive messages
- Engage in heated arguments
- Use the discussion to vent frustrations
- Make it personal

- "Hi folks" or "Hey everyone"
- "Please ping me if you have questions"
- "Maintainers"
- "Developers" or "Contributors"
- "Person with a disability"
